Repair the durability of your items.

This mod is a rewrite of the original Mending by Wastelander. It introduces the Mending Table and allows you to completely repair the durability of weapons, clothes and armor.

You need to research Mending in order to build the Mending Table, it requires mending kits built in the electric tailoring workbench, easy version doesn't require them. Work modifiers apply so you can speed up the work done.
